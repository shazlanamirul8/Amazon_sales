# Amazon_sales
This is my second SQL portfolio project. I am using the Amazon Sales dataset from Kaggle to practice more challenging SQL queries. The goal of this project is to strengthen my SQL skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and business analysis by exploring sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
